# Azure and Node.js Bots Workshop

Originally given at MinneWebCon 2018 on April 24.

## Workshop Goal

Build a basic bot that accepts a user question, parses it, and returns a response.

- Leverage Azure Bot Service
- Leverage Bot Builder SDK
- Leverage Cognitive Services

## Cost and Pricing

We will be using Azure cloud services. There will be a minimal cost to deploy Azure Storage. Storage costs $0.002/GB so we're talking < $1. The rest of the services we'll use are totally free.

If you do not already use Azure, the [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) for initial signups provides $200 credit for 30 days and 12 months of access. After that, you will be on the Pay-as-you-Go plan but you can delete the workshop services way before that starts.

From Microsoft:

> A phone number, a credit or debit card, and a Microsoft Account username. Credit card information is used for identity verification. You wonâ€™t be charged until you upgrade.
